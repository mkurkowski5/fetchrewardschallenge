Hello,

TL;DR: Do we have data validation for scanning receipts?  (If not, can we add it?)  Can we adjust our current data storage structure?

I'm looking into our Receipts, Users, and Brand data and I had a couple questions about our current setup:
  1. What sort of data validation do we perform on receipts that are scanned in?  Is there a way to ensure there is a brand match before we process the
      receipt?
  2. I will be speaking more with the data team about this, but are there any objections on the business side to storing our data in a few more schema
      than we currently do, even if it means adding up to a second of processing time on the frontend?

The context here is that we have several receipts that have "barcode not found" or are flagged and may be holding the key to important trends as to which 
  of our users are most likely to scan a receipt, which brands they are scanning for, what text or incentives these brands put on the receipt that make
  users more likely to scan them, etc.  On the data storage side, we would ideally split receipt data into relevant groupings so that when we run queries 
  to identify trends, they not only run more quickly, but then the business processes or product adjustments we make as a result of those trends will 
  drive user engagement, which a more robust data structure will be able to handle better than what we have currently.  

Thanks for your help,
Michael
