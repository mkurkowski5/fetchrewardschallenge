/*
Two questions to investigate with very similar queries:
• When considering average spend from receipts with 'rewardsReceiptStatus’ of ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’, which is greater?
• When considering total number of items purchased from receipts with 'rewardsReceiptStatus’ of ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’, which is greater?
*/

select avg(totalspent) AcceptedAmt from purchases
where rewardsreceiptstatus = '"""ACCEPTED"""';

select avg(totalspent) RejectedAmt from purchases
where rewardsreceiptstatus = '"""REJECTED"""';


select sum(purchaseditemcount) AcceptedItemCnt from purchases
where rewardsreceiptstatus = '"""ACCEPTED"""';

select sum(purchaseditemcount) RejectedItemCnt from purchases
where rewardsreceiptstatus = '"""REJECTED"""';
